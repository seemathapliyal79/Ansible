Sometimes you want a task to run only when a change is made on a machine. For example, you may want to restart a service if a task updates the configuration of that service, but not if the configuration is unchanged. Ansible uses handlers to address this use case. 
Handlers are tasks that only run when notified.Handlers must be named in order for tasks to be able to notify them using the notify keyword.

Tasks can instruct one or more handlers to execute using the notify keyword. 
The following example demonstrates how multiple handlers can be notified by a single task:
---
tasks:
- name: Template configuration file
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: template.j2
    dest: /etc/foo.conf
  notify:
    - Restart apache
    - Restart memcached

handlers:
  - name: Restart memcached
    ansible.builtin.service:
      name: memcached
      state: restarted

  - name: Restart apache
    ansible.builtin.service:
      name: apache
      state: restarted
